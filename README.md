## For Developers

To compile the program on your your machine

- Clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio
- Install all the Nuget packages (Visual Studio should prompt you on first run that the Nuget packages are out of date)

If you can't compile the program after cloning, it's most likely that you do not have the Nuget packages installed.
